## PyARM-Assembler 

Assembler for [ARM assembly language](http://www.toves.org/books/arm/). 
An assembler is just a simple program that is supposed to convert assembly code to 
machine code(binary). 
Given an assembly code to our assembler, we want it to spit binary.
eg: 
```
MOV R3, R9   # assembly
1110 0001 1010 0000 0011 0000 0000 1001  # binary

```
